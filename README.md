This is a personal portfolio website of theme Ubuntu 20.04, made using Next.js & Chakra UI. If you want to edit this. Clone this project and edit the files in /pages/components.

To run this on localhost type yarn dev and when u are done coding type yarn run build to build your app.

NOTE: if you have npm just replace yarn dev and yarn run build with npm dev and npm build.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/components files`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
